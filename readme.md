# SELECTIVE WHOLE WORD CENSOR v1.3

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4100)

-------

## Introduction
This mod changes the censor functionality of the forum so that the admin can choose whether a word is censored on a whole-word basis or a partial basis, since there are some words that should be filtered in every possible permutation, and other words that can be part of a regular, non-censored word (like, hypothetically, "danger").

## Admin Settings
On the **Admin** -> **Forum** -> **Posts and Topics** -> **Censored Words** page, a checkbox is added beside each line to indicate whether the word specified is searched for on a whole-word basis or not.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.11 and 2.1 Beta 3, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
